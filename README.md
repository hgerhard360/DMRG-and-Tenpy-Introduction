# DMRG-and-Tenpy-Introduction
An introduction to matrix product states (MPS), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and TenPy, a Python library that can implement DMRG and other tensor network algorithms. 

This was the report from my Spring 2024 research rotation in my first year of graduate studies. The rotation was under Dr. Wladimir Benalcazar, who became my Ph.D. advisor the following Summer.
